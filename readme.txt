== Description ==

= maWidgets =

maWidgets is a great way to share products and services on third-party websites and blogs. 
When you place a widget on a third-party website or blog, you will be able to display product details and information, share reviews, 
offer purchasing capabilities, and allow others the ability to search your Web Portal’s 35 million+ products.

= Earn Cashback! =
Anyone you refer can earn up to 35 percent Cashback for shopping on marketamerica.com wherever you see the ma Cashback logo. 
Plus, you get a ½ percent on referral purchases forever. Find exactly what you need from millions of products and services using our search technology. 
Shop from home and save time, gas, and the hassle of fighting the crowds. The ma Cashback program rewards you for doing what you already love to do – shop! 
If you post maWidgets on your self-hosted WordPress website, you expose the ma Cashback program and can earn ½ percent on others' purchases by doing so!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to configure the User Id & Password? =

Technically, no. Your maWidgets should work perfectly without these. However, you may not be **paid** because the widget does not know your information. 
It is recommended that you enter your **PCID/Email** as User Id and **Password**, validate to make sure these work, and update settings to get 
paid from your maWidgets.
